From the ZapEsp32 Web UI, click the `UID CONTROL` menu item.
  
UID Audio control allows you to set audio clips for read only RFID Tags or NFC devices (eg amiibo's).  When in UID Control ZapEsp32 will enter a special UID scanning mode. Now when you scan a RFID/NFC device it will send the NFC TAG UID number to the browser, where you can set the audio clip file (mp3) you wish to play on Launch and Remove. Remember to click save for each TAG/NFC device you scan.

_**NOTE**_: You must change to a different UI page from the Menu, or click Reset & Reload in the bottom left to change ZapEsp32 back into normal operating mode when finished.
