From this page you will be able to search for games, and set the Launch & Remove event audio clip files for each Card/Tag you create.  The process is guided and the UI will tell you when to place your Card/Tag on/in the ZapEsp32 for writing. You should start by removing all cards/tags currently on/in the ZapEsp32.

### Create Zaparoo Mapping  
**Zaparoo** has an internal mapping database which allows the mapping of a read-only NFC Tag/Amiibo UID to a set of commands which will execute when the UID of the Tag is sent to Zaparoo. The **ZapEsp32** **`Create Zaparoo Mapping`** button enables the creation of a simple mapping in the **Zaparoo** mapping database to launch the selected game plus set launch and remove audio file paths for **ZapEsp32**.   
  
Click the **`Create Zaparoo Mapping`** button, and follow the on screen prompts.
  
_**Note:**_ If an existing Mapping DB entry already exists for the UID of the scanned Tag/Amiibo, it will be overwritten. Existing UID Audio file paths will be also be overwritten.   
  
## Manual Mode  
Selecting Manual from source list, enables you to set the test for all three card/tag fields manually. The card writing process follows the same steps as above.
